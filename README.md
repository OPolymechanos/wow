# wow
A Wownero-themed Minetest Mod featuring
- Wownero ore
- Wownero coins 
    - Coins are mine-able as ore or "mine-able" as random drops using a special pickaxe
    - Coins can be baked in a furnace to create edible coins that give temporary speed/jump boost when eaten
- A special pickaxe
    - Mining with pickaxe gives a small chance of dropping Wownero coins
    - Crafting: Any pick + WOW coin (shapeless)
    - NOTE: The wownero coin drop-rate is currently unbalanced with the pickaxe wear, etc. This means that, in its current state, this mechanic will inevitably lead to high levels of monetary inflation on a server environment.
- Donate Signs
    - Players can place signs containing their wallet address to allow for donations of real WOW outside of the game.
    - Crafting: Wooden sign + WOW coin (shapeless)
    - Minor bug: When a player is editing a sign, it's possible for another player to click on the same sign and receive the same edit privileges as the sign-owner.
- Shop node
    - Shop nodes make it easy to sell items for WOW coins
    - Operate as vending machines and may be set up and checked periodically
    - Crafting: Locked chest + WOW coin (shapeless)
